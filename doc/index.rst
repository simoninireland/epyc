epyc: Computational experiment management in Python
===================================================

Vision: Automated, repeatable management of computational experiments
---------------------------------------------------------------------

``epyc`` aims to simplify the process of conducting large-scale computational experiments.


What is ``epyc``?
------------------

``epyc`` is a Python module that conducts computational
experiments. An experiment is simply a Python object that is passed a
tuple of parameters which is uses to perform some computation
(typically a simulation) and return a tuple of results. ``epyc``
allows a single experiment to be conducted across a space of
parameters in a single command, configuring and running the experiment
at each point in the parameter space. The results are collected
together into a notebook along with the parameters for each result and
some metadata about the performamnce of the experiment. Notebooks are
immutable, can be persistent, and can be imported into ``pandas`` for
analysis.

``epyc`` can run the same experiment sequentially on a single local
machine, in parallel on a multicore machine, or in parallel on a
distributed compute cluster of many machines. This allows simulations
to be scaled-out with minimal re-writing of code. Moreover jobs
running on compute servers don't require the submitting machine to
remain connected, meaning one can work from a laptop, start a
simulation, and come back later to collect the results. Results can be
collected piecemeal, to fully support disconnected operation.


Current features
----------------

* Single-class definition of experiments

* Run experiments across an arbitrarily-dimensioned parameter space
  with a single command

* Different experimental designs for managing how many experimental
  runs are needed, and at what points

* Experiment combinators to control repetition and summarisation,
  separate from the core logic of an experiment

* Immutable storage of results

* Experiments can run locally, remotely, and in parallel

* Works with Python 3.6 and later, and (to a limited extent) with PyPy3

* Remote simulation jobs run asynchronously

* Start and walk away from remote simulations, collect results as they become available

* Fully integrated with ``ipython`` and ``ipyparallel`` for parallel and distributed simulation

* Fully compatible with ``jupyter`` notebooks and labs

* Annotated with ``typing`` type annotations
