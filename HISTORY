Version 0.13.3 2018-03-27

   - Updated some docstrings that were misleading
   - Tightened-up type checking for variable results argument
   - Re-introduced the use of Dill by default
   
Version 0.13.2 2018-03-23

   - Fixed a bug in adding repeated experiments to notebooks

Version 0.13.1 2018-03-22

   - Got rid of the chunking as there seems to be a race condition
     in ipyparallel or ZeroMQ. A small delay fixes it (for now)
   - Changed the way repeated experiments work, from returning a
     list of results dicts to returning a single one whose results
     were a list of results dicts (so embedding the list one level down)
   - Corresponding changes to summary experiments
   - Added more summary information to summary experiments
   - Removed the default use of dill in ClusterLab
   - ADded documentation for ExperimentCombinator
   
Version 0.12.1 2018-03-09

   - Chunked downloading of pending results from clusters to work around
     some undocumented limits in some database backends 
   - Added slightly improved error handling in summary experiments

Version 0.11.2 2018-03-06

   - Maintenance release changing the build system slightly to allow for
     auto-generation of documentation on readthedocs.io 

Version 0.11.1 2018-03-05

   - Stringified tracebacks so the work better remotely
   - Updated build system somewhat

Version 0.10.1 2016-06-23

   - Added traceback objects to metadata for failed experiments, to help debugging
   - Fixed JSON notebooks to handle tracebacks
   - Added slightly more documentation in places

Version 0.9.1 2016-12-02

   - Changed scale of timing metadata from milliseconds to seconds 
   - Replaced generated doc/conf.py with a static file
   - Added creation of HTML doc ZIP file
   
Version 0.8.1 2016-11-01

   - Added cancellation of pending results to ClusterLab
   - Added Sphinx API documentation
   - Converted class and method docstrings to Sphinx
   - Made labs treat string parameters as single values, not iterables 

Version 0.7.1 2016-08-30

   - Added Lab.dataframe() method to save going to the notebook
   - Added updateResults() at Lab level, removed now-unnecessary
     overriding at ClusterLab level
   - Optimised updateResults() to grab all completed pending results
     in a single network transaction
   - Added global wait() to ClusterLab, coding around the
     ipyparallel.Client code's wait() method (which can't be used
     directly -- see notes in the method)

Version 0.6.2 2016-08-23

   - Oops, forgot to fix one of the changed method names....
   
Version 0.6.1 2016-08-23

   - Refactored experiment combinators
   - Fixed summarisation of non-list-returning experiments

Version 0.5.1

   - Some refactoring
   - Improved exception-handling
   - Fixed integration with JSON persistence

Version 0.4.1 2016-08-12

   - Changed notebooks to keep lists of results for each point in
     their parameter space
   - Improved handling of pending results
   - Allowed addition of lists of results, and experiments that return
     lists of results
   - Made all the classes "new style", based on object
   - Changed Experiment metadata to use datetime objects
   - Added Python datetime <-> ISO datetime string handling to JSON
     notebooks
   - Improved notebook persistence tests
   - Refactored repeated experiments to separate repetition and
     summarisation

Version 0.3.1 2016-07-29

   - Made parameter spaces of a single point work properly
   - Re-wrote Experiment to clean up the logic and allow better
     repetition 

Version 0.2.1 2016-07-28

   - Test suite skips cluster tests if there isn't one running
   - Added repeated experiment combinator
   - Removed SQL-backed notebooks for the time being, until finished

Version 0.1.1 2016-07-15

   - Initial experiment, lab, and notebook implementations
   - Cluster labs
   - Test suite
